This site/application would be a simple recipe creator and storer. There’d be a “main page” that was a list of boxed elements containing any immediately identifiable information about each recipe, like cook time, image, name, etc. Each of these elements would then link to a separate HTML page on the site, created by the user, which would list the full extent of the recipe.
